Once, there was a BukkitEvent who eagerly planned his birthday party but was upset when no one attended. In response, he created a clone named BukkitEvent the 2nd. BukkitEvent the 2nd adopted a child and named him BukkitEventListener, to listen to all BukkitEvent. Together, they promoted a creeper to be BukkitEvent the 3rd.
